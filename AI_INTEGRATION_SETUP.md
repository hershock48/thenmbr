# AI Integration Setup Guide

## OpenAI API Integration

The newsletter builder now includes real AI-powered content review and optimization. To enable this feature:

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Set Environment Variable
Add to your `.env.local` file:
\`\`\`
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
\`\`\`

### 3. Install OpenAI Package
\`\`\`bash
npm install openai
\`\`\`

### 4. Features Enabled
With OpenAI integration, the AI Review feature provides:
- **Real content analysis** - AI analyzes your newsletter content
- **Engagement optimization** - Suggestions for better donor engagement
- **Tone and clarity** - Recommendations for clearer communication
- **Call-to-action improvement** - Better conversion-focused CTAs

### 5. Fallback Behavior
If OpenAI is not configured, the system falls back to:
